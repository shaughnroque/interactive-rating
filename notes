Your users should be able to:

Select and submit a number rating
See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


Problem

- User selects a rating from 1-5
- User then clicks submits to submit rating
- When submitted the "Thank You" card should show up

how to solve this?

create the thank you card dynamically?
or
when the user clicks the submit button add a class that shows the thank you card component

remove class card-container when user clicks submit and then add the class thank you container to provide information when user submits
 
on the thank you card the rating of what the user clicked needs to show
